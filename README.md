There are 2 kind of search technique available
1) keyword search
2) semantic search

   1) keyword search uses direct test search like traditional database and etc.
   2) semantic search did the vector search and find the nearest match
      It uses 2 technique
      a) ucledian distance
      b) cosine similarity

TF-IDF and BM25 those are 2 algorithm used for vectorization.
Eg: While TF-IDF heavily penalizes the cookbook chapters for having lower keyword density (0.5% vs. 5%), BM25's document length normalization reduces this penalty. Additionally, its term frequency saturation means those 30 mentions in the cookbook chapter still count significantly.
